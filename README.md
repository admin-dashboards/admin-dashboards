## The motivation

If you are a freelancer or a small startup, and you have in your portfolio an admin dashboard product, trying to promote it and sell it, can be challenging without a serious budget. The first page in Google for the keyword “admin dashboards” is full of well-positioned companies like ColorLib, WrapBootstrap, and other companies at the same level.

<br />

## The plan

To get Google's attention, we need to pass this simple checklist:

- A fast, well-structured website
- Specific content
- No bullshit or spam
- Good referrals  

<br />

## Implementation

- The domain name **admin-dashboards.com**, match 100% the keyword we are targeting, .. **and it was free!**.

- **The speed**. I was testing a few SSGs (Hugo, Gridsome, Jekkyl, Gatbsy) but the winner was [Ghost](https://ghost.org/) a free and open source blogging platform written in JavaScript and distributed under the MIT License, designed to simplify the process of online publishing for individual bloggers as well as online publications coded in Node.js, Ember.js.

- **The website structure**:

  - Categories are keywords related to the main website keyword `admin dashboard`. The winners (selected by the search volumes) are:
  - `react dashboard` - 2.9k mo searches
  - `vue dashboard` - 1k mo searches
  - `angular dashboards` - 2.9k mo searches
  - `flask dashboard` - 0.7k mo searches
  - Products. Each dashboard will be listed in two places: as an item in the mother category, and as a single page, in the root of the website. See the website files structure bellow, for more information

- **The content**: the information for each product will be curated to provide only relevant information to the audience. 

- **The referrals** The Github repository was created to follow the domain signature. `github.com/admin-dashboards`. Also, the products, with a little bit of traction from the audience, will have a correspondent project on Github, on address `github.com/admin-dashboards/killer-dashboard`. Google loves this kind of s**t, and will rank the project better than others, because the information (keyword, content) is consistent, across multiple domains.
